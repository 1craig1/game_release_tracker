# Game Pre-Order & Release Tracker
## Project Overview
### Problem 
There are many games being released every day, and it is challenging for individuals to keep track of the release dates for all the games they are interested in. The information on the release dates of games may also be spread across multiple platforms, with no central source for all of them. This can lead to people missing the release dates for games they wanted to play. 

Our project plans to tackle this problem by creating a system that gathers information on upcoming titles and helps the users keep track of all the games they are interested in.

### Main Features
- List upcoming games alongside their release dates
- Display countdown timer to games releases
- Allow users to join a wishlist for games they are interested in
- Notify users when games that are on their wishlist are released
- Provide links alongside games to a service where users can pre-order the game
